# üìä Data-Driven Performance Analysis of Zomato Restaurants using SQL, Excel & Power BI

---

## üèÅ Executive Summary
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of the **Zomato restaurant dataset** to extract key insights about restaurant performance, pricing strategy, customer preferences, and operational trends.  
Using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, the analysis translates raw restaurant data into meaningful business intelligence that can guide data-driven decisions for restaurant aggregators and food delivery businesses.

## üíº Business Problem
With increasing competition among online food delivery platforms, understanding the dynamics of restaurant performance and customer behavior is critical.  
The project addresses the following business questions:

- What are the **top-performing cities and countries** based on the number of restaurants and average ratings?  
- How do **pricing ranges** and **average ratings** correlate with customer engagement?  
- What are the **seasonal or monthly patterns** in restaurant openings?  
- What percentage of restaurants provide **table booking** and **online delivery**, and how does it affect performance?  
- Which **cuisines and categories** dominate in different regions?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning (Excel & SQL)**
   - Used Excel to perform data validation, handle missing entries, and remove duplicates.  
   - Applied SQL queries (`SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`) for data extraction and aggregation.  
   - Built country and calendar reference tables for temporal and geographic analysis.

2. **Data Modeling (SQL & Power BI)**
   - Created relationships between fact and dimension tables (Country, City, Calendar).  
   - Calculated new attributes: `financial_month`, `financial_quarter`, `year_month`, and `weekday_name`.

3. **Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Designed interactive dashboards with KPIs such as total restaurants, average ratings, and delivery availability.  
   - Used slicers and filters for dynamic insights across regions and cuisines.  
   - Created drill-through functionality for granular city-wise and cuisine-wise performance.

4. **Analytical Insights (Excel & Power BI)**
   - Implemented advanced Excel formulas (`SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, `INDEX-MATCH`, `DATEPART`).  
   - Used DAX in Power BI for calculating measures and trend analysis.  
   - Combined visual storytelling and analytical metrics to highlight performance gaps.
